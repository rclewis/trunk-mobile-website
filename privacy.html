        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective July 9, 2025</p>
        <p>Trunk: Smart Packing Assistant (“Trunk”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Trunk does not collect or transmit any personal data to our servers or to third parties. All of your data, including items, trips, and packing lists, is stored locally on your device.</p>
        <p>We do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, or contact information</li>
            <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IP address or advertising ID)</li>
            <li>Location from GPS</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Trunk uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">WeatherAPI</span> — to look up and validate structured location information (such as city name, region, and coordinates) based on user input when planning trips. This allows the app to store clean, structured location data that may be used later to provide relevant weather information. No GPS or background location access is used. Only the place name you provide is sent to WeatherAPI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not share any personal information with WeatherAPI.</p>
        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>In the future, Trunk may offer in-app purchases (e.g., a Pro subscription) through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. All payment processing is handled securely through those platforms. We do not collect or store payment information ourselves.</p>
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms. You are responsible for backing up your device. If you delete the app, all application-specific data stored locally on your device — including your trips, items, and packing lists — will be lost.</p>
        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Trunk is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any data from children.</p>
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage users to review this page periodically for any updates. Continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
        <p>If we introduce features that materially affect how your data is handled — such as cloud storage or user accounts — we will provide additional notice and may require you to accept the updated terms before continuing to use those features.</p>
