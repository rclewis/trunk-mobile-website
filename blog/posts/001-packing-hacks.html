            <h1>10 Packing Hacks Every Frequent Traveler Swears By</h1>
            <p>Whether you're a seasoned globetrotter or a once-a-year vacationer, packing efficiently can make or break your trip. Smart travelers know that it’s not about bringing <em>more</em> — it’s about bringing <em>better</em>. Here are 10 time-tested packing hacks to help you travel lighter, smarter, and stress-free.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Roll, Don’t Fold</h2>
            <p>Rolling your clothes instead of folding them saves space and reduces wrinkles. It’s especially effective for t-shirts, pants, and other soft garments.</p>

            <h2>2. Use Packing Cubes</h2>
            <p>These zippered fabric containers keep your suitcase organized and compress your clothes to maximize space. Bonus: categorize by type or outfit for easy access.</p>

            <h2>3. Pack Outfits, Not Items</h2>
            <p>Instead of thinking “three shirts, two pairs of pants,” plan full outfits based on your itinerary. This prevents overpacking and ensures you don’t forget essentials like socks or accessories.</p>

            <h2>4. Choose a Color Palette</h2>
            <p>Stick to neutral or complementary tones so every top can match every bottom. This keeps your wardrobe flexible without needing more items.</p>

            <h2>5. Wear Your Bulkiest Items on the Plane</h2>
            <p>Jackets, boots, or oversized sweaters take up the most space. Wear them in transit to save room in your bag (and stay cozy on chilly flights).</p>

            <h2>6. Decant Toiletries into Small Bottles</h2>
            <p>Don’t bring full-size products. Use TSA-approved travel bottles and only take what you’ll actually use. You’ll save weight and avoid leaks.</p>

            <h2>7. Stuff Shoes with Socks or Cables</h2>
            <p>Shoes take up valuable space — fill them with rolled-up socks, chargers, or other small items to make use of every inch.</p>

            <h2>8. Use a Digital Packing List</h2>
            <p>A smart packing assistant (like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/trunk-smart-packing-assistant/id6747906870">Trunk</a>) can help you track what you’ve packed, avoid duplicates, and remind you of commonly forgotten items.</p>

            <h2>9. Pack a Lightweight Laundry Bag</h2>
            <p>Bring a foldable bag to separate dirty clothes as your trip goes on. It helps keep things fresh and simplifies unpacking later.</p>

            <h2>10. Leave a Bit of Empty Space</h2>
            <p>You’ll probably pick up souvenirs, brochures, or impulse buys — make sure your bag has room for the return journey.</p>

            <p><strong>Final Tip:</strong> Packing doesn’t have to be a last-minute stressor. With the right strategy — and the right tools — it becomes part of the adventure.
