            <h1>How Trunk Helps You Pack Smarter, Not Harder</h1>

            <p>Packing for a trip doesn’t have to mean spreadsheets, scribbled lists, or that nagging feeling you’ve forgotten something. <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/trunk-smart-packing-assistant/id6747906870" style="text-decoration: none;">Trunk</a></strong> is your personal packing assistant — helping you stay organized, stress-free, and ready for adventure.</p>

            <h2>Say Goodbye to Forgotten Essentials</h2>
            <p>Trunk helps you build packing lists that match your trip. Whether it’s a weekend getaway or a multi-city journey, Trunk keeps track of what you’ve packed — and what you haven’t.</p>

            <h2>Make Your Packing List Once. Reuse It Forever.</h2>
            <p>Save your favorite items and reuse them for future trips. Trunk remembers your essentials so you don’t have to start from scratch every time.</p>

            <h2>Pack Smarter with Item Suggestions</h2>
            <p>Trunk learns from your habits and trip types. Headed somewhere warm? Traveling with kids? Expecting rain? Trunk tailors suggestions based on location, length, and preferences.*</p>

            <p><em>*Pro features coming soon — including weather-based suggestions and smart reminders.</em></p>

            <h2>Track What’s Packed — and Where</h2>
            <p>Assign items to specific bags or luggage and keep tabs on your packing progress. Never again wonder which bag you put your phone charger in.</p>

            <h2>Build Once, Use Everywhere</h2>
            <p>Trunk is available on iOS today and coming soon to Android. Whether you're prepping from your couch or the airport lounge, your packing list stays with you.</p>

            <p>Smarter travel starts before you leave. Let Trunk handle the details — so you can focus on the journey.</p>
